Stylesheets and FontAwesome:

External stylesheets (style.css) and FontAwesome icons are correctly linked. You included two FontAwesome links, but only one is necessary.
Suggestion: Remove the duplicate link for FontAwesome for efficiency.
Header Section:

Logo and Navigation Menu:
Structure is good. The logo image is placed well, with button-based navigation links.
Improvement: Use semantic <nav> tag for better accessibility and SEO.
Ensure buttons are styled to look like navigation links to match the design.
Icons (Search, Location):
Using FontAwesome icons adds to the interactivity. The animated effects like fa-shake and fa-beat are visually appealing but may cause performance issues if overused.
Main Content Sections:

First Div (Intro Content):
The text "MORE PERFORMANCE. MORE EFFICIENCY. MORE ENJOYMENT." is clear. Ensure that the text and heading (SkyActivÂ®) are responsive for different screen sizes.
Second Div (Performance and Fuel Efficiency):
Good use of text and layout. Make sure that this content is optimized for readability on smaller screens by using media queries for font sizes and padding.
Third Div (Engine Section):
The image and text are well-positioned, but ensure that the image scales properly for mobile and smaller screens. Consider using percentage-based widths instead of fixed sizes.
Fourth Div (Transmission Section):
Similar feedback to the third div: Ensure the image adapts for smaller screens.
Images (Divs 4, 5, 6, 7):

Images are large and take up full width, which is visually appealing. However, the height and width values are hardcoded.
Improvement: Use responsive image techniques (e.g., max-width: 100%, height: auto) to ensure proper scaling on all devices.
Footer Section:

Good layout with columns for navigation, social media icons, and legal information.
FontAwesome icons for social media and accessibility are well-placed and animated.
Improvement: Consider removing the animated bounce effect if it distracts users or impacts performance.
Accessibility: Adding proper alt text for icons (e.g., aria-label="Facebook") will improve accessibility.
Add a <footer> tag to clearly identify the footer section semantically.
Legal Section:

Clear and concise, with links to legal documents. It's a solid layout and easy to navigate.
General Improvements:
Responsiveness: Add media queries to handle the layout on smaller screens (e.g., font sizes, image scaling).
Performance: Remove unnecessary duplicate links (e.g., FontAwesome) to speed up loading times.
Accessibility: Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) are easily navigable by screen readers.
